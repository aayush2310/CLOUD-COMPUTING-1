The move to virtualized data centers,introduced customers to two new types of offerings:-
1)Infrastructure as a service(IaaS):-IaaS offerings provide raw compute,storage and network capabilities,organized virtually into resources that are similar to physical 
                                     data centers.In the IaaS model,customers pay for the resources they allocate ahead of time.
2)Platform as a service(PaaS):-PaaS offerings,in contrast bind code to libraries that provide access to the infrastructure that the application needs.This allows more 
                               resources to be focussed on application logic.In the PaaS model,customers pay for the resources they actually use.
                               
                               
As cloud computing has evolved,the momentum has shifted towards managed infrastructure and managed services.Leveraging managed resources and services allows companies to 
concentrate more on their buisness goals and spend less time and money on creating and maintaining their technical infrastructure.It allows companies to deliver products 
and services to their customrers more quickly and reliably.
Serverless is yet another step in the evolution of cloud computing.It allows developers to concentrate on their code,rather than on server configuration,by eliminating the 
need for any infrastructure.
Serverless technologies offered by google include cloud functions,which manages event driven code as a pay as you go service.And cloud Run,which allows customers to deploy 
their containerized microservices based application,in a fully managed enviironment.

SaaS(Software as a service applications) arent installed in your local computer.Instead,they run in the cloud as a service and are consumed directly over the internet by
end users.Popular google applications such as Gmail,Docs and Drive,that are part of Google Workspace,are all eg. of SaaS.
